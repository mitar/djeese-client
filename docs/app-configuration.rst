################################
Djeese Application Configuration
################################

Applications for the Djeese Application Store must provide a configuration file
describing the properties and settings of an application.


*************************
Configuration File Format
*************************

Djeese Application Configurations are written in the INI file format as
understood by Python's `ConfigParser`_ module. While not required we recommend
you use the ``.ini`` extension for those files.

.. note::

    We decided to use file-based configurations over a web form so you can use
    your favorite version control system to version the configurations if you
    want to. This is optional of course. Further it keeps some options open for
    our command line tool in the future.


The Djeese Application Configuration file must have an ``app`` section and can
optionally have a ``templates`` section as well as a section for each setting
defined in the ``settings`` option in the ``app`` section.


The ``app`` Section
===================

The ``app`` section is the main (and only required) section in your Djeese
Application Configuration file. It has following **required** options:

* ``name``: The (unique) verbose name of your application.
* ``packagename``: The package name of your application.
* ``version``: The version of your application this configuration file
               describes. This does not have to be a version available on PyPI
               but rather is an internal version for djeese.
* ``installed-apps``: A list of application names this application needs to
                      have in Django's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
* ``description``: A description of your application. May be multiple lines.
* ``license``: The license type of this application (BSD, MIT, proprietary, ...).
* ``license-path``: Path to the license text file. Must be accessible when
                    running ``uploadapp``.
* ``url``: The URL to your applications project page.


It may further have following **optional** options:

* ``settings``: A list of settings this application exposes. The names given
                here do not have to be the actual setting names, but are merely
                references to a section with the same name in this file.
* ``author``: The name of the author of this application.
* ``author-url``: The URL to the authors website.
* ``translation-url``: Link to the translation page for this project, for
                       example the transifex page.
* ``plugins``: A list of plugin (class) names this application provides.
               Required for successful uninstallations.
* ``apphooks``: A list of apphook (class) names this application provides.
                Required for successful uninstallations.

The ``templates`` section
=========================

The ``templates`` section defines templates that should be editable through
djeese by the users. For CMS Plugins this should include the template that gets
rendered by the plugin. Admin templates can and probably should be omitted.

The keys to this section are the template paths as used by Django's template
system. The values are paths to the template source code, which must be
accessible when running ``uploadapp``.


The setting sections
====================

For each setting defined in the ``settings`` option of the ``app`` section, you
must create a section with the same name. This section has following
**required** options:

* ``name``: The name of this setting. This is the name used in Python.
* ``verbose-name``: The verbose name of this setting as used on the djeese site
                    when the user is prompted to configure this setting.
* ``type``: The type of this setting. Available values are: :term:`string`,
            :term:`stringlist`, :term:`stringtuplelist`, :`boolean`,
            :term:`staticfile` and :term:`choices`. 

It may also include the following **optional** options:

* ``default``: The default value for this setting. Only available for the
               ``string`` type at the moment.
* ``required``: If set to ``false`` makes this setting optional. By default all
                settings defined are required.
* ``editable``: If set to ``false`` makes this setting non-editable. This
                requires the setting to have a ``default`` set. This option
                should be avoided if possible. 

The :term:`staticfile` type also has following **optional** option:

* ``file-extension``: Allowed file extension, for example ``png``. If omitted,
                      any file type that can be uploaded using pushstatic can
                      be used.

The :term:`choices` type also has following **required** option:

* ``choices``: The name of the configuration section that holds the choices.
               That section must exist. The sections keys are the values to be
               saved to the setting, the sections values are the labels to
               display in the forms.
